# Routes
A simple app to search for routes and timetables of Florian√≥polis's public transportation.

# Build Settings:
The App was made in swift and built using IOS 9.1 and xcode 7.1, it has 3 dependencies maneged by cocoapods,(Alamofire, SwiftyJSON and MBProgressHUD) but no action is needed to download the dependencies once the pod directory is also under the version control
(I'm aware of the war that this subject raises, but I am only folowing a github recommendation, please don't throw knives on me).

To built the project, please use the Routes.xcworkspace.
